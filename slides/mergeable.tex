\frametitle{Background on distributed estimators}

\vspace{0.10in}
There are many distributed estimators

\vspace{0.10in}
\emph{Interactive} algorithms use many rounds of communication
\begin{itemize}
\item Solve the ERM problem in a distributed environment
\item High accuracy $O(\sqrt{d/mn})$
\item Slow 
\item Difficult to implement
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.10in}
\emph{Non-interactive} algorithms use only a single round of communication
\begin{itemize}
\item Solve an easier problem related to ERM
\item Low accuracy, typically $O(\sqrt{d/n})$
\item Fast 
\item Easy to implement with standard toolkits and MapReduce
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.10in}
Recent work shows that no non-interactive algorithm can have the same guarantees as ERM

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Use a non-interactive algorithm to create a warm start

\item
Use an interactive algorithm to "polish" the answer
\end{itemize}

Tangent:

\begin{itemize}
\item
I spent 2 semesters teaching in North Korea

\item
One of the courses was on open source machine learning software

\item
North Korean students added a new feature to Vowpal Wabbit

\item
I believe this is the first open source contribution from a North Korean
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Some recent results}

Bias reduction
\begin{itemize}
\item
If the datasets on each machine overlap each other, then there is a reduction in bias
(Zinkevich et al., 2012)

\item
Estimate the bias via a bootstrap subsample (Zhang et al., 2012)

\item
Closed form estimates of the bias in certain limited cases (Lee et al., 2015; Battey et al., 2015)

\item
Closed form formula for the optimal $\lambda$ in kernel ridge regeression (Zhang et al., 2013)

\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.15in}
Bounds on distributed learning algorithms

\begin{itemize}

\item
At least $\Omega(m\min\{n,d\})$ bits must be transferred for $O(\sqrt{d/mn})$ error rate
(Braverman et al., 2016)

\item
No non-interactive distributed estimator cannot have error decrease at $O(\sqrt{d/mn})$ in the general case
(Liu and Ihler, 2014)

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Semi-interactive estimators}

I'm proposing a semi-interactive algorithm called the optimal weighted average (OWA)
\begin{itemize}
\item
Two rounds of communication instead of one

\item
Therefore, the existing performance bounds don't apply, has better performance guarantees

\item
Still have the speed advantages of non-interactive algorithms

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
