\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}

Mergeable machine learning algorithms are important.

They need not have poor statistical bounds.

The can be used as a warm start to interactive algorithms.

Need more work to determine common themes among mergeable algorithms, especially wrt curvature.

Future work on algebra.

Relational algebra supports merging along columns of data (joins).
Copulae already handle this case.

Groups allow subtracting of data points.
This is unstudied.
